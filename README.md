This repository includes my analysis from the new pharmaceutical company, Pymaceuticals, Inc. The drug of interest, Capomulin, has showed promising results in reducing tumor growth with the mice compared to the other tested treatment regimens. I think it will be important in the future to test Capomulin on a larger time frame for drug administration as this would illustrate to us the length of time the drug can be given to the mice while reducing tumor size, before the toxicity levels become too elevated.


I received some coding support from StackOverflow for this assignment in terms of utilizing the .groupby, .loc, and tips for the plots.
